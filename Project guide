Logistics operation Dashboard — Step-by-Step Guide
Introduction
This guide explains the structure, usage, and maintenance of the Supply Chain Insights Power BI project.
It's written for analysts, report authors, and maintainers.
Prerequisites
• Power BI Desktop (recommended latest stable release)
• Access to source data (CSV, SQL, or other connectors)
• Basic knowledge of Power Query and DAX
Project structure
The .pbix contains data model (tables), queries (Power Query), measures (DAX), and report pages.
Typical pages:
• Overview — Key KPIs and executive summary
• Inventory — Stock levels, aging, by location
• Orders — Order status, fulfillment funnel
• Suppliers — Lead times, on-time delivery
• Logistics — Shipping performance & transit times
Data sources & transformation
Open Transform Data to view each query. Follow these steps:
1. Inspect each query's source step (CSV path or DB connection string).
2. Validate applied steps (rename, change type, merges).
3. If replacing with your data, adjust column names or add mapping steps.
4. Set Query Dependencies -> Review privacy levels if using multiple sources.
Data modeling & relationships
Ensure primary key relationships: Orders -> OrderLines (OrderID), Products/SKUs linked to OrderLines
(SKU), Suppliers linked by SupplierID. Check relationship cardinality and cross-filter direction to enable
correct filtering.
Key measures (DAX) — examples & tips
This project uses DAX measures for KPIs. Common patterns used:
• Total Quantity = SUM(OrderLines[Quantity])
• OnTime% = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Orders), Orders[DeliveredOnTime]=TRUE),
COUNTROWS(Orders))
• InventoryDays = DIVIDE([OnHandQty], [DailyAvgUsage])
Tip: Use variables (VAR) in complex calculations to improve readability and performance.
Reports & visuals — how to use
• Use slicers to change date, location, and supplier context.
• Drillthrough pages allow row-level analysis—right-click a visual to drillthrough.
• Tooltips show supporting metrics; edit them from the Format pane.
Performance & optimization
• Disable auto date/time if using a Date table.
• Remove unused columns in Power Query to reduce model size.
• Use star schema where possible; avoid circular relationships.
• Reduce cardinality by rounding or bucketing where fine-grained values aren't necessary.
Deployment to Power BI Service
1. Save .pbix and publish via Home → Publish to Power BI Service workspace.
2. Configure dataset credentials and refresh schedule in the Service.
3. Pin visuals to a dashboard or create an app for wider distribution.
Troubleshooting
• Refresh errors: Check credentials, privacy levels, and gateway configuration.
• Slow visuals: Inspect DAX queries (Performance Analyzer) and simplify measures.
• Missing data: Confirm filter context and data type mismatches.
Appendix — recommended next steps
• Document complex DAX in a markdown file inside /docs.
• Create parameterized data sources for Dev/Prod.
• Add sample data CSVs under /data for reproducibility.
